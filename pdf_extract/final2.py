SAFETY DATA SHEET
STAINBLASTER ENZYME BOOST

900245 -02 3 / 8  01.03.2024  Hazardous combustion
products  : Decomposition products may include the following materials:
Carbon oxides
Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
Sulfur oxides
Oxides of phosphorus

Special protective equipment
for fire -fighters  : Use personal protective equipment.

Specific extinguishing
methods  : Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must be
disposed of in accordance with local regulations.

SECTION  6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal precautions,
protective equipment and
emergency procedures  : Remove all sources of ignition. Ensure clean -up is conducted by
trained personnel only. Refer to protective measures listed.

Environmental precautions  : Do not allow contact with soil, surface or ground water.

Methods and materials for
containment and cleaning up  : Eliminate all ignition sources if safe to do so. Stop leak if safe to do so.
Contain spillage, and then collect with non -combustible absorbent
material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite) and place
in container for disposal a ccording to local / national regulations (see
section 13). Flush away traces with water. For large spills, dike spilled
material or otherwise contain material to ensure runoff does not reach
a waterway.

SECTION  7. HANDLING AND STORAGE

Advice on safe handling  : Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Keep away from fire, sparks and
heated surfaces. Take necessary action to avoid static electricity
discharge (which might cause ignition of organic vapors). Wash hands
thoroughly after handling. I n case of mechanical malfunction, or if in
contact with unknown dilution of product, wear full Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE).

Conditions for safe storage  : Keep away from heat and sources of ignition. Keep away from
oxidizing agents. Keep out of reach of children. Store in suitable
labeled containers.

Storage temperature  : 0 °C  to  50 °C
