But "not getting bullied" is entirely different thing than trying and hoping to push the US into civil war (which is just bonkers).

If your system were under version control, so that Claude could do whatever it wanted on its own branch, so to speak, would it still be such a big problem? Because you could just roll back if it really did cause problems, couldn't you?

Just last week, I was accused on HN of "not knowing what I'm talking about" when sharing data showing, and my interpretation of a declining US dollar globally.It is so obvious in the context of globalization: countries seeking power will chip away at fiscal dominance of others with a thousand cuts. Why wouldn't they? Especially after years of getting bullied. So many people are so dependent on this reality that I think it's going to happen long before any Americans accept it has happened.

I agree, this is likely the technology for the next few decades.Electric motors are far more efficient at producing mechanical energy than a engine+transmission combo is. But at the same time, batteries suck.

Except for the electronic subsystem, almost everything else in an ICE car can be repaired by a competent non-dealer mechanic shop.I do agree though that modern ICE vehicles are becoming more and more complex, with electronic subsystems replacing manual subsystems. Many car manufacturers are pushing for hybrids, which have the partial advantages & disadvantages of both ICE & EV worlds. But for any EV (including the Nissan Leaf), repairs & advanced diagnostics on the electric-drive components (which is basically the main component of the EV), health checks on the battery (other main component), or repairs involving high-voltage systems, are typically out of the competency and ambit of a non-dealer mechanic, unless the mechanic shop is a dealer-certified EV-trained service center. However, the routine mechanical work — things like brakes, suspension (e.g., sway bar links, shocks), tires, wheel alignment, cabin filters, etc. — can generally be done safely and correctly by a good independent mechanic, whether it be for an ICE vehicle or an EV.

In "defense" of Republicans, the MAIN reason for deficit increasing under Republicans is that their administrations often end with some type of economic disaster. Their increased spending is part of the picture, but not as responsible as the impacts from final year recessions.

Have you been to Japan? Salaries are low, but stuff is crazy cheap (even after the past year of inflation). People are still feeling whiplash from the fact that prices can change at all. Many menus and items have prices that have barely changed since the early 1990s, and most of those changes were to add sales taxes to the menu.The exchange rate of the yen has dropped recently by a lot, but the inflation experience there has been the exact opposite of America's.
